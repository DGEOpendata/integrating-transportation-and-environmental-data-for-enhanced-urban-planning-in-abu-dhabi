# Integration of Transportation and Environmental Data for Urban Planning

## Overview
This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for integrating transportation infrastructure data with environmental quality indicators to enhance urban planning in Abu Dhabi. This approach aims to optimize transportation systems while ensuring environmental sustainability.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library
- Geopandas library

## Installation
Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:
bash
pip install pandas matplotlib geopandas


## Dataset Description
- **Transportation Data**: Details on roads, public transport routes, and transport hubs in Abu Dhabi.
- **Environmental Data**: Indicators of air and water quality, and waste management statistics.

## Example Code
The provided Python script demonstrates how to merge and visualize these datasets. The script loads CSV files, merges them based on a common key (e.g., area ID), and uses Geopandas to create spatial visualizations.

## Usage
1. **Load Datasets**: Ensure your datasets are in CSV format and contain common keys for merging.
2. **Merge Datasets**: Use Pandas to merge datasets on a shared column.
3. **Visualize Data**: Utilize Geopandas and Matplotlib for visual representation. Customize plots as needed to highlight specific trends.

## Conclusion
This integrated approach provides a comprehensive understanding of transportation and environmental dynamics in Abu Dhabi, aiding in informed decision-making for sustainable urban development. Regularly update datasets and utilize visualization tools to maintain dataset relevance and engagement.
